# Placeholder for NVIDIA Driver Manifest Hash
#
# This file should contain the SHA3-256 hash (32 bytes) of the NVIDIA
# driver manifest including:
# - Driver version (e.g., 535.104.05)
# - CUDA version (e.g., 12.4.1)
# - GPU compute capability (e.g., 8.0 for A100)
# - Driver capabilities (CUDA, OpenGL, Vulkan)
#
# Extraction process:
# 1. Run: nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version,compute_cap --format=csv
# 2. Run: nvcc --version
# 3. Concatenate version strings
# 4. Compute SHA3-256 hash
# 5. Replace this placeholder with the 32-byte hash
#
# Purpose: Ensures reproducible GPU execution by anchoring driver version
# Different drivers may produce different numerical results
#
# Format: 32 bytes raw binary (SHA3-256 digest)
# Current: All zeros (placeholder)
