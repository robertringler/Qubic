Revision Roadmap for "The Anti-holographic Entangled Universe"

Goal: produce a publishable RevTeX manuscript (PRX/PRD/JHEP target) with reproducible simulations and at least one falsifiable observational prediction.

Phase 0 — Project setup (today)
- Create and commit `RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (done).
- Create `revision_roadmap.md` (this file).
- Create a `simulations/` folder and minimal runner scripts (next).

Phase 1 — Core theory fixes (1–2 weeks)
- Task A: Expand Introduction
  - Add physical motivations and clear problem statement (2–4 edited paragraphs).
- Task B: Energy & causality proofs
  - Expand Appendix B with detailed energy density computations and a proof sketch for compatibility with ANEC/QNEC where possible (adds ~2–4 pages).
- Task C: Strengthen Theorem III.1
  - Provide explicit tensor-network construction, derive entropy bounds, and include a worked example (d=3, α=0.8).

Deliverable: updated manuscript PDF with extended theory sections and Appendix B.

Phase 2 — Models & numerics (1–2 weeks)
- Task D: Implement toy tensor-network simulator (Python, NumPy) in `simulations/` that constructs hierarchical networks with variable branching and bond-dimension profiles.
- Task E: Produce plots: S(ℓ) vs ℓ, finite-size scaling, correlation decay, and OTOC behavior. Save figures in `manuscript/figures/`.
- Task F: Add a short results section with interpretation and code references.

Deliverable: figures and scripts, updated Section VI with plots and captions.

Phase 3 — Observational predictions (1–2 weeks)
- Task G: Build simple CMB modification model using modified primordial power spectrum P(k)=P_BD(k)M(k) with M(k)=1+μ(k/k_*)^{-σ}.
  - Compute C_ell modifications using CAMB/CLASS or approximate analytic estimates for large scales; produce constraints using Planck limits (rough bounding will suffice for manuscript-level claims).
- Task H: Compute large-scale correlation function modifications and estimate BAO/weak-lensing effects.
- Task I: Derive decoherence timescales for macroscopic superpositions under AEU-induced noise.

Deliverable: Section on observational consequences with at least one quantitative, falsifiable claim and a table comparing to ΛCDM.

Phase 4 — Polish & submission (1 week)
- Task J: Clean up LaTeX, fix two-column figure sizing, remove any stray macros, ensure all citations match `references.bib`.
- Task K: Run full build, produce RevTeX source and final PDF, assemble reproducibility archive (zip) including `README.md` with build instructions.
- Task L: Prepare an arXiv submission package and pre-submission checklist; optionally prepare a shorter PRX-style letter if the community wants a high-impact venue.

Deliverable: final manuscript PDF, submission-ready RevTeX source, and reproducibility archive.

Milestones and checkpoints
- After Phase 1: internal review — verify Appendix B plausibility and that Theorem III.1 detail is sufficient.
- After Phase 2: unit tests and CI to run the toy simulations and regenerate plots.
- After Phase 3: sanity-check observational numbers against Planck/BAO constraints.

Risks & mitigations
- Risk: QNEC/ANEC proofs may not hold generally — mitigation: provide clear assumptions and show parameter ranges where claims hold; reframe claims as conjectures with supporting examples when necessary.
- Risk: CMB/BAO computations require heavy tools — mitigation: use analytic approximations for large scales or run lightweight CLASS/CAMB calls on a local machine, and provide code to reproduce.

Notes on authorship and credibility
- Seek one or two established co-authors for the final submission (acknowledge contributors in README and commit history).
- Publish code alongside arXiv submission and include a DOI for the code archive (Zenodo/GitHub Releases).

If you want, I can now:
- (A) Create an initial `simulations/` folder with a minimal Python script that generates a hierarchical tensor network and computes entanglement estimates for small N (quick), or
- (B) Start expanding Appendix B with explicit energy-density calculations and a worked example for d=3, α=0.8.

Which should I do next? (A) simulations scaffolding, or (B) expand Appendix B? If neither, tell me what to prioritize and I'll proceed.
