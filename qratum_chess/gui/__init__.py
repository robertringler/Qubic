"""QRATUM-Chess GUI and Visualization System.

This module implements a state-of-the-art, research-grade interactive interface
that exposes tri-modal cognition, Anti-Holographic behaviors, quantum augmentation,
and telemetry for the QRATUM-Chess engine.

Components:
- Board Panel: 2D/3D toggle with move highlighting and PV lines
- Tri-Cortex Diagnostics Panel: Heatmaps and contribution visualizations
- Search Tree Explorer: Real-time MCTS/AAS tree visualization
- Motif & Novelty Tracker: Emergent pattern detection and highlighting
- Quantum Panel (Optional): Qubit encodings and amplitude distributions
- Anti-Holographic Indicator: Stochasticity and destabilization metrics
- Performance Telemetry: Nodes/sec, latency, hash hit rates
- Command/Control Panel: Game modes, settings, and audit logging
