"""Anti-Holographic Tensor Compression Algorithm (AHTC).

This module implements quantum-aware tensor compression with entanglement
preservation and guaranteed fidelity bounds. The algorithm uses anti-holographic
information flow principles to achieve 10-50x compression while maintaining
F(ρ, ρ′) ≥ 0.995.

Key Features:
    - Entanglement-aware compression
    - GPU-accelerated CUDA kernels
    - Adaptive truncation with fidelity guarantees
    - Deterministic reproducibility for certification
