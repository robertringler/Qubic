# Empirical Evidence Extractor

The **Empirical Evidence Extractor** ingests exported ChatGPT `conversations.json` files, breaks every assistant response into sentences, classifies the scientific quality of each statement, tags relevant domains, and produces traceable artifacts for downstream analysis.

## Features

- Deterministic sentence segmentation implemented with spaCy's lightweight sentencizer.
- Heuristic multi-class classification for empirical confidence levels.
- Domain tagging across physics, math, computer science, engineering, biology, biometrics, chemistry, and space systems.
- Artifact generation:
  - `empirical_knowledge_ledger.jsonl`: JSON lines ledger with UUID IDs and traceability metadata.
  - `corpus_classification_summary.csv`: aggregate counts and top domain associations.
- Rich CLI (`python -m extractor.run`) with configurable logging.
- Modular, fully type annotated codebase with pytest coverage and mypy/flake8 compatibility.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python -m extractor.run --input /path/to/conversations.json --out artifacts/
```

The command prints logging information describing how many messages were parsed and where the resulting artifacts were saved.
