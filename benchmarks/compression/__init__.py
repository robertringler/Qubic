"""MERA Compression Benchmark Suite.

This module provides empirical validation of QRATUM's MERA tensor compression claims.
It generates compression artifacts and validates fidelity preservation across diverse
quantum state types.

Key Components:
    - State generators: Quantum state generation utilities
    - Validators: Fidelity and compression ratio validation
    - Orchestrator: Benchmark execution and reporting
