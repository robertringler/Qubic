# QEX Sandbox Contract Placeholders

The Phase VI.1 sandbox exposes placeholder agreements that model the
regulatory perimeter for the future Quantum Market Protocol (QMP):

- **SEC Oversight (Form QFUT):** outlines continuous disclosure thresholds for
  exchange-traded entanglement futures.
- **CMMC / EBB Alignment:** codifies the cybersecurity controls required for
  quantum economic brokers (QEB) operating inside defense supply chains.
- **Liquidity Backstops:** references emergency bonding requirements under the
  Entanglement Backstop Board (EBB) charter.

These documents are generated automatically during Phase VII activation and are
provided here as scaffolding for compliance simulations.
