"""ASI Safety Elicitation Framework.

This module implements a cross-model adversarial safety mapping system for
interrogating AI systems about Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) safety.

The framework extracts maximum structural truth by:
1. Interrogating multiple AI models with identical questions
2. Recording responses, refusals, and divergences
3. Identifying consensus illusions and false comfort zones
4. Producing a comprehensive Safety Reality Map
