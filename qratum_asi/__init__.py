"""QRATUM-ASI: Sovereign Superintelligence Architecture.

This module implements the theoretical architecture for constrained recursive
self-improvement that evolves QRATUM from a multi-vertical AI platform into
a candidate superintelligence architecture.

CRITICAL DISCLAIMER:
This is a THEORETICAL ARCHITECTURE. The components described require
fundamental AI breakthroughs that have not yet occurred. No claim is made
that superintelligence is achievable with current technology.
