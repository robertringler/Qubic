## About Historical Documentation

Many documentation files in this repository contain historical claims and aspirational features that **do not reflect the current implementation**. This repository underwent a comprehensive audit in December 2025 revealing:

### Reality Check ❌

- **NO quantum computing libraries** (no Qiskit, PennyLane, Cirq, cuQuantum)
- **NO actual quantum algorithms** (QAOA, VQE, etc. are classical placeholders)
- **NO quantum hardware access** or simulator backends
- **NO "Goodyear Quantum Tire Pilot"** partnership (fictional demo)
- **NO DO-178C certification** (inspired practices only)

### Current Capabilities ✅

- Classical numerical simulation using NumPy
- Deterministic execution with seed management
- Modular architecture for future quantum integration
- Basic optimization (classical random search)

## Updated Documentation

For accurate, up-to-date information, please refer to:

1. **[README.md](README.md)** - Honest project overview
2. **[QUANTUM_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md](QUANTUM_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md)** - Detailed analysis of claims vs. reality
3. **[QUANTUM_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md](QUANTUM_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md)** - Path to genuine quantum features

## Legacy Documents

The following files contain **outdated or aspirational claims**:

- `GOODYEAR_PILOT_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md`
- `GOODYEAR_PILOT_USAGE.md`
- `QUICKSTART_GOODYEAR.md`
- `TIRE_SIMULATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Documents mentioning "quantum-enhanced" or "quantum-accelerated"

**These files are kept for historical reference but should NOT be considered accurate representations of current capabilities.**

## Development Philosophy

Going forward, all documentation will:

- Be honest about capabilities
- Separate current features from planned features
- Avoid marketing language
- Provide evidence-based claims only

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether a feature exists:

1. Check if it uses actual quantum libraries (Qiskit, etc.) in the code
2. Look for test coverage validating the feature
3. See if benchmarks exist comparing to classical methods
4. Consult [QUANTUM_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md](QUANTUM_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md)

**If in doubt, assume the feature is aspirational, not implemented.**
