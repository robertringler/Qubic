name: "Develop QuNimbus Cloud — Quantum-Optimized Cloud Fabric for QuASIM"

description: |
  Architect and implement an end-to-end, autonomous cloud environment natively integrated with QuASIM.
  Design for magnitude-level efficiency improvements (≥10× performance/$ vs leading public clouds) through
  GPU/quantum co-scheduling, anti-holographic state compression, and intelligent energy routing.
  Deliver a reproducible GitOps-managed cluster architecture, full CI/CD pipeline, zero-trust security layer,
  and SDK integration for QuASIM modules.

objectives:
  - Design next-generation cloud platform purpose-built for QuASIM's quantum-classical workloads
  - Achieve ≥10× efficiency improvement vs AWS/GCP/Azure through quantum-aware optimization
  - Implement compliance-first isolation domains (DO-178C L-A, CMMC 2.0 L2, NIST 800-53)
  - Deliver anti-holographic tensor compression and RL-driven autoscaling
  - Create reproducible GitOps infrastructure with zero-trust security
  - Generate comprehensive SDK for seamless quantum-classical orchestration

notes: |
  This task defines the complete specification for QuNimbus, the quantum-optimized cloud fabric
  for QuASIM. Upon execution, GitHub Copilot will scaffold the entire infrastructure, generate
  all necessary configuration files, implement the SDK, and produce comprehensive documentation.
  
  The resulting system will provide a self-sovereign, quantum-accelerated cloud platform that
  dramatically outperforms traditional public clouds for quantum-classical workloads while
  maintaining strict compliance with aerospace and defense regulations.
  
  QuNimbus represents a paradigm shift in cloud computing architecture, purpose-built for the
  quantum era with native support for quantum circuits, tensor networks, and hybrid algorithms.
