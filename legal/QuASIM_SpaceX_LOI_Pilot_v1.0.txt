1. PURPOSE AND INTENT

   This Letter of Intent (LOI) outlines the non-binding terms for a pilot 
   collaboration between QuASIM and SpaceX to evaluate QuASIM's quantum-inspired 
   autonomous simulation platform for aerospace trajectory optimization and 
   mission planning applications.

2. PILOT SCOPE

   2.1 Phase 1: Technical Validation (90 days)
       - Integration of QuASIM runtime with SpaceX trajectory optimization tools
       - Validation against historical mission data (Falcon 9, Starship)
       - Performance benchmarking: RMSE < 2%, fidelity ≥ 0.97
       - Deterministic reproducibility validation (<1μs seed replay drift)

   2.2 Phase 2: Operational Testing (120 days)
       - Pre-flight trajectory analysis for upcoming missions
       - Monte Carlo campaign simulation (1,024+ trajectories)
       - Integration with SpaceX mission control systems (sandbox environment)
       - Performance at scale: GPU acceleration validation

   2.3 Deliverables
       - Technical validation report
       - Integration architecture documentation
       - Performance benchmark results
       - Recommendation for production deployment

3. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

       - 99.95% SLA uptime guarantee

   3.2 SpaceX Integration Points
       - Trajectory optimization API integration
       - Mission telemetry data ingestion
       - Real-time simulation dashboard
       - Export-controlled data isolation (ITAR compliance)

4. COLLABORATION MODEL

   4.1 Joint Engineering Team
       - 2 QuASIM quantum simulation engineers
       - 2 SpaceX trajectory optimization engineers
       - Weekly technical sync meetings
       - Shared Slack channel / collaboration platform

   4.2 Data Sharing
       - SpaceX provides sanitized historical mission telemetry
       - QuASIM provides platform access and simulation results
       - All data subject to Mutual NDA
       - Export-controlled data remains on SpaceX infrastructure

5. COMMERCIAL TERMS (NON-BINDING)

   5.1 Pilot Phase: No-cost evaluation
       - QuASIM provides platform access at no charge
       - SpaceX provides engineering resources and data access

   5.2 Post-Pilot Commercial Agreement (indicative terms)

       - Based on mission volume and GPU compute hours
       - Volume discounts for multi-year commitments
       - Production deployment support included

   5.3 Success Metrics for Commercialization
       - RMSE < 2% on trajectory predictions
       - Fidelity ≥ 0.97 vs. actual flight data
       - Runtime: 10-100× faster than existing tools
       - Zero unplanned downtime during pilot

6. MILESTONES AND TIMELINE

   - M1.1: Platform integration complete (Day 30)
   - M1.2: Historical data validation (Day 60)
   - M1.3: Phase 1 report delivery (Day 90)

   Month 4-7: Phase 2 Operational Testing
   - M2.1: Pre-flight analysis integration (Day 120)
   - M2.2: Monte Carlo campaign validation (Day 150)
   - M2.3: Final recommendation (Day 180)

   Month 8: Decision Point
   - Go/No-Go for production deployment
   - Negotiate definitive commercial agreement

7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

   7.1 Background IP
       - Each party retains ownership of pre-existing IP
       - QuASIM retains all rights to platform, algorithms, and source code
       - SpaceX retains all rights to mission data and internal tools

   7.2 Foreground IP (Work Product)
       - Integration code: Joint ownership
       - Improvements to QuASIM platform: QuASIM ownership
       - SpaceX-specific configurations: SpaceX ownership
       - Publications require mutual written consent

8. COMPLIANCE AND SECURITY

   8.1 Regulatory Compliance
       - ITAR compliance for export-controlled technical data
       - NIST 800-53 (HIGH baseline) for federal missions
       - CMMC 2.0 Level 2 for defense contractor requirements
       - DO-178C Level A certification posture maintained

   8.2 Security Requirements
       - QuASIM platform deployed in SpaceX-controlled environment (Phase 2)
       - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required
       - Audit logging and monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
