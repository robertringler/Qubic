## The Opportunity

Traditional quantum computers cannot be certified for safety-critical systems. Classical HPC is performance-bounded. **QRATUM created the Certifiable Quantum-Classical Convergence (CQCC) category** — the only platform combining quantum-enhanced performance with aerospace certification and defense compliance.

**Market:** $12B+ addressable (aerospace $4.5B, healthcare $3.2B, financial $2.8B, energy $1.5B)

---

## Product

**QRATUM Platform:**
- Hybrid quantum-classical runtime (NVIDIA cuQuantum + Qiskit)
- DO-178C Level A certification pathway (aerospace safety-critical)
- NIST 800-53 Rev 5 compliant (98.75%, HIGH baseline)
- CMMC 2.0 Level 2 certified (defense contractors)
- Deterministic reproducibility (<1μs seed replay drift)
- Multi-cloud Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS, 99.95% SLA)

**AI Platform Extension:**
- Model serving (FastAPI, GPU/CPU autoscaling)
- RAG pipeline (vector DB, embeddings)
- Safety engine (PII/secret filtering)
- MLOps (Argo workflows, artifact signing, SBOM)

## Competitive Advantage

| Feature | QRATUM | IBM Quantum | AWS Braket | Classical HPC |
|---------|--------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Quantum algorithms | ✅ VQE, QAOA | ✅ Advanced | ✅ Multiple backends | ❌ None |
| Aerospace cert (DO-178C) | ✅ Level A pathway | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Defense compliance (CMMC) | ✅ Level 2 | ❌ No | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Varies |
| Deterministic replay | ✅ <1μs drift | ❌ Nondeterministic | ❌ Nondeterministic | ⚠️ Varies |
| Enterprise Kubernetes | ✅ Multi-cloud | ⚠️ Cloud-only | ⚠️ AWS-only | ⚠️ Varies |

**Moat:** QRATUM is the only platform where quantum advantage meets regulatory certification.

## Go-To-Market

**Phase 1 (Q1 2026):** Pilot deployments in aerospace & defense  
**Phase 2 (Q2-Q3 2026):** Healthcare/pharma vertical expansion  
**Phase 3 (Q4 2026):** Financial services & energy  
**Phase 4 (2027+):** Desktop edition, commercial rollout

**Pricing Model:**
- Enterprise License: $250K-$500K/year (on-premise or cloud)
- Pilot Program: $50K (3-month evaluation)
- Desktop Edition: $5K/seat/year (planned)

**Sales Strategy:**
- Direct sales to Fortune 500 (aerospace, defense, pharma)
- Federal contracts (NASA, DOD, DARPA)
- Channel partners (cloud providers, systems integrators)

---

## Technology Differentiation

**Quantum Capabilities (Honest Assessment):**
- NISQ-era algorithms (VQE, QAOA)
- Effective qubit count: ~10-20
- Classical simulation for validation
- IBM Quantum hardware support

**Not a pure-play quantum computer** — QRATUM is a hybrid platform where quantum algorithms run within a certified, compliant, enterprise-grade infrastructure.

**Current Limitations:**
- Quantum advantage not yet demonstrated (NISQ hardware limits)
- Problem sizes limited by effective qubit count
- Classical methods often faster for small-scale problems

**Future Roadmap (dependent on quantum hardware evolution):**
- Error mitigation (2026)
- Larger systems (4-6 qubits, 2026)
- Fault-tolerant quantum (2028+, if available)

---

## Team

**Core Competencies:**
- Quantum computing (Qiskit, cuQuantum)

## Investment Ask

**Seeking:** $5M Series A  
**Use of Funds:**
- Engineering (60%): Expand quantum algorithms, desktop edition, error mitigation
- Sales (25%): Build aerospace/defense/pharma sales team
- Operations (15%): Compliance audits, infrastructure, legal

**Milestones:**
- 10 pilot customers by Q2 2026

---

## Why Now?

1. **Quantum maturity:** NISQ hardware now available (IBM, Google, AWS)
2. **Regulatory demand:** Aerospace/defense requiring certified quantum
3. **AI convergence:** RAG, LLMs creating demand for hybrid platforms
4. **Market gap:** No competitor offers quantum + certification

**QRATUM is uniquely positioned at the intersection of quantum computing, aerospace certification, and enterprise AI.**
