# Real-World Policy Enforcement

QuNimbus real-world policies validate grounded observations before they influence scenarios or node decisions. Deterministic checks:
- Market liquidity thresholds
- Flight envelope velocity/angle limits
- Grid frequency bounds
- Scientific protocol completeness

Policies return explicit violation labels so node governance and policy sandboxing can trace every enforcement step.
