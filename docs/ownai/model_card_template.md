### Bias and Fairness

[Discussion of potential biases in training data and model outputs]

## Ethical Considerations

### Transparency

This model is designed for transparent, auditable AI applications:
- All predictions are hashable and traceable
- QGH ledger maintains complete run history
- TERC observables provide ongoing monitoring

### Responsible Use

Users should:
- ✅ Validate predictions on their specific data
- ✅ Monitor for distribution shift
- ✅ Ensure appropriate use cases
- ✅ Consider fairness implications
- ✅ Maintain human oversight for critical decisions

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk:** Academic research, non-critical analysis
- **Medium Risk:** Business intelligence, recommendation systems
- **High Risk:** Healthcare, finance (requires additional validation)
- **Prohibited:** Safety-critical systems without certification

## Monitoring

### Recommended Monitoring

- **Stability Margin:** Monitor across deployments (target ≥ 0.90)
- **QGH Consensus:** Verify determinism regularly
- **Prediction Drift:** Track distribution changes
- **Latency:** Monitor p50/p95 latencies

### TERC Observables

The following observables should be continuously monitored:

| Observable | Target | Action Threshold |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| stability_margin | ≥ 0.90 | < 0.80 |
| qgh_consensus | True | False |
| emergent_complexity | < 0.20 | > 0.30 |
| goal_progress | ≥ 0.70 | < 0.60 |
