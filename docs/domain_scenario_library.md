# Domain Scenario Library

Reusable templates cover multiple domains:
- **Aerospace**: launch anomaly with guidance drift, comms loss, engine issue, recovery
- **Finance**: liquidity crunch, policy intervention, contagion, stabilization
- **Energy**: grid instability, outage, remediation
- **Network**: latency spike, partition, reroute, heal
- **Pharma**: trial execution with adverse events and supply disruption

Each template defines a deterministic Timeline and domain driver hooks into simulation layers.
