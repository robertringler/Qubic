# Provisional Quantacosmic Framework Patent Notes

This document captures the provisional claims and descriptive material for the Quantacosmic
simulation architecture integrated into QuASIM.

## Claims Overview

1. **Symbolic Temporal Curvature Modelling** – Leveraging REVULTRA frequency parameters to
   produce deterministic curvature quotients suitable for realtime evaluation.
2. **Coupled Lattice Evolution** – Discrete lattice propagation using symmetric coupling
   operators to ensure stable integration across diverse substrates.
3. **Action-Oriented Feedback Loop** – A midpoint discretised functional that links field
   samples to cumulative action estimates, providing a controllable optimisation target for
   design automation workflows.

## Implementation Notes

The patent-ready artefacts emphasise reproducibility and clarity. All modules share a common
philosophy: deterministic numerical pathways coupled with intuitive interfaces. These
characteristics allow compliance validation and continuous integration to exercise the full
stack without manual supervision.
