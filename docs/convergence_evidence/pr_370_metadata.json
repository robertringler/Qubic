The core compression algorithm uses singular value decomposition with adaptive truncation to achieve compression while maintaining quantum state fidelity above specified thresholds.\n\n**Key changes:**\n- Implemented entropy-based compression pipeline with SVD decomposition, adaptive truncation, and fidelity-preserving reconstruction\n- Integrated compression capabilities into TensorNetworkEngine, MultiQubitSimulator, StateVector, and Simulator classes\n- Added 21 comprehensive tests for compression correctness, fidelity guarantees, deterministic behavior, and performance targets\n\n### Reviewed changes\n\nCopilot reviewed 6 out of 6 changed files in this pull request and generated 14 comments.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Show a summary per file</summary>\n\n| File | Description |\r\n| ---- | ----------- |\r\n| `quasim/holo/anti_tensor.py` | Core compression implementation with entropy spectrum computation, SVD-based decomposition, adaptive truncation, and compress/decompress pipeline |\r\n| `tests/holo/test_anti_tensor_impl.py` | Comprehensive test suite with 21 tests covering reconstruction error, entropy reduction, deterministic replay, compression ratios, and fidelity guarantees |\r\n| `quasim/qc/quasim_tn.py` | TensorNetworkEngine integration with compress_state() and load_compressed_state() methods |\r\n| `quasim/qc/quasim_multi.py` | MultiQubitSimulator integration with checkpoint_state() and restore_checkpoint() for persistent storage |\r\n| `qratum_ai_platform/core/statevector.py` | StateVector compression API with compress() method and CompressedStateVector class |\r\n| `qratum_ai_platform/core/simulator.py` | Simulator integration with run_with_compression() for memory-efficient circuit execution |\r\n\r\n**Critical Issues Found:**\r\n1. **Incorrect fidelity calculation** in adaptive_truncate (line 310) - squares the fidelity target incorrectly, leading to overly aggressive compression\r\n2. **Misleading compression ratio** (line 538) - only counts singular values without accounting for U/Vh matrix storage, making ratios artificially high\r\n3. **Incorrect mutual information** estimation (lines 149-155) - concatenation-based joint entropy is mathematically wrong\r\n\r\n**Moderate Issues:**\r\n- Missing test coverage for all integration methods (compress_state, checkpoint_state, run_with_compression)\r\n- Potentially problematic npz serialization of nested dictionaries with arrays\r\n- Unclear API with union return types and overly permissive parameter types\r\n- Global random seed modification can affect user code\r\n- Periodic compression doesn't actually reduce memory as intended\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n","submittedAt":"2025-12-26T23:21:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"45adaf0556de2bfe03bec90febd503366b0023d3"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOOs42Vc7XaJsg","author":{"login":"copilot-swe-agent"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2025-12-26T23:57:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"69666642325b9a34b56596381b5a9bc5faef05d2"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOOs42Vc7XaJsh","author":{"login":"copilot-swe-agent"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2025-12-26T23:57:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"69666642325b9a34b56596381b5a9bc5faef05d2"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOOs42Vc7XaJsl","author":{"login":"copilot-swe-agent"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2025-12-26T23:57:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"69666642325b9a34b56596381b5a9bc5faef05d2"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOOs42Vc7XaJsm","author":{"login":"copilot-swe-agent"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2025-12-26T23:57:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"69666642325b9a34b56596381b5a9bc5faef05d2"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOOs42Vc7XaJtk","author":{"login":"copilot-swe-agent"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2025-12-26T23:57:36Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"69666642325b9a34b56596381b5a9bc5faef05d2"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOOs42Vc7XaJtl","author":{"login":"copilot-swe-agent"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2025-12-26T23:57:36Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"69666642325b9a34b56596381b5a9bc5faef05d2"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOOs42Vc7XaJtn","author":{"login":"copilot-swe-agent"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2025-12-26T23:57:36Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"69666642325b9a34b56596381b5a9bc5faef05d2"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOOs42Vc7XaJtp","author":{"login":"copilot-swe-agent"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"","submittedAt":"2025-12-26T23:57:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"69666642325b9a34b56596381b5a9bc5faef05d2"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOOs42Vc7XaKJ_","author":{"login":"robertringler"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"","submittedAt":"2025-12-27T00:04:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED","commit":{"oid":"69666642325b9a34b56596381b5a9bc5faef05d2"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOOs42Vc7XaKg3","author":{"login":"robertringler"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"","submittedAt":"2025-12-27T00:09:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"APPROVED","commit":{"oid":"69666642325b9a34b56596381b5a9bc5faef05d2"}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Replace AHTC placeholder stubs with production SVD-based tensor compression"}
