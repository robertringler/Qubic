# QRATUM Convergence Evidence Artifacts

This directory contains evidence artifacts generated by the convergence evidence collection scripts.

## Purpose

This directory stores measured ground truth data about the QRATUM repository state and PR merge readiness. Evidence artifacts are required before any PR transition (rebase, draft exit, merge) can be authorized.

## Evidence Artifacts

When evidence collection is run, this directory will contain:

### Repository-Level Artifacts
- `main_head_sha.txt` — Current HEAD SHA of origin/main
- `open_pr_snapshot.json` — Full list of open PRs with metadata
- `open_pr_snapshot.txt` — Human-readable PR list
- `open_issue_snapshot.json` — Open issues for cross-reference
- `verification_timestamp.txt` — Evidence collection timestamp
- `evidence_manifest.json` — Validation manifest

### Per-PR Artifacts (for each Tier-1 PR)
- `pr_<NUM>_head.log` — Recent commit history
- `pr_<NUM>_head_sha.txt` — Branch HEAD SHA
- `pr_<NUM>_meta.json` — PR metadata (mergeable, CI, reviews)
- `pr_<NUM>_checks.txt` — CI check status (human-readable)
- `pr_<NUM>_checks.json` — CI check status (structured)
- `pr_<NUM>_diffstat.txt` — Diff statistics vs main
- `pr_<NUM>_changed_files.txt` — List of changed files

## Generating Evidence

Run the evidence collection workflow:

```bash
./scripts/convergence/collect_tier1_evidence.sh
```

Or collect evidence for a specific PR:

```bash
./scripts/convergence/capture_pr_evidence.sh <PR_NUMBER>
```

## Verification

After evidence collection, verify all required artifacts exist:

```bash
for pr in 370 387 378 197 149; do
    if [ ! -f "docs/convergence_evidence/pr_${pr}_meta.json" ]; then
        echo "GATE FAILURE: Missing evidence for PR #$pr"
        exit 1
    fi
done
echo "GATE PASSED: All evidence artifacts present"
```

## Important Notes

- Evidence artifacts are **generated dynamically** and represent point-in-time repository state
- Evidence should be regenerated before any merge decision
- Do not manually edit evidence artifacts
- Evidence artifacts may be committed to provide historical snapshots

## System Invariant

**The repository does not proceed on inference. It waits for measurement.**
