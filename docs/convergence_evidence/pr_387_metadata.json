It introduces a WASM pod isolation system for sandboxed execution and provides rich UI panels for quantum circuit simulation and deterministic code generation (DCGE).\n\n**Key Changes**:\n- Advanced quantum gates (Phase/S, T, Toffoli/CCNOT) with inline matrix implementations\n- Complete Pauli gate set (Y, Z) added to existing X gate\n- WASM pod isolation structures with memory limits (OSSupreme: 64KB, MiniQuASIM: 2MB, MiniLM: 8MB)\n- Interactive quantum simulation panel with 12-qubit visualization\n- DCGE code generation panel with AST/IR views and benchmark comparisons\n\n### Reviewed
