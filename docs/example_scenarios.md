# Example Scenarios

## Aerospace Launch Anomaly

- Sequence: liftoff → guidance drift → comms loss → engine issue → recovery
- Expected outcome: incidents logged for engine issue; recovery restores stability.

## Finance Liquidity Crunch

- Sequence: calm market → liquidity crunch → policy intervention → contagion → stabilization
- Expected outcome: incident on liquidity crunch; stabilization reduces impact.

## Policy Sandbox Run

- Apply conservative vs. interventionist policy variants to the finance scenario.
- Reports show comparative metrics and incident counts for deterministic selection.
