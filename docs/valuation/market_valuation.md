## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

The DCF approach projects 5-year unlevered free cash flows for each scenario and calculates present value using WACC. Terminal value is computed using the Gordon Growth Model.

**Formula:**
```
FCF = NOPAT + D&A - CapEx - ΔWC
PV(FCF) = Σ FCF_t / (1 + WACC)^t
Terminal Value = FCF_terminal × (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
Enterprise Value = PV(FCF) + PV(Terminal Value)
```

### 1.2 Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation samples probability distributions for key parameters:
- Revenue growth rates (mean ± 25%)
- Gross margins (mean ± 5%)
- OpEx ratios (mean ± 4%)
- Discount rate (mean ± 3%)

Runs 20,000 simulations to generate enterprise value distribution.

### 1.3 Real Options Valuation

Real options capture strategic flexibility value:
- **Expansion Option:** Right to scale into adjacent markets
- **Delay Option:** Value of deferring investment pending market validation
- **Licensing Option:** IP monetization through partnerships

Uses Black-Scholes framework adapted for real options valuation.
