## 6. Investment Memo (Two-Page Condensed Narrative)

**Thesis:** Invest to secure a controlling minority position ahead of Series A, enabling QVR / QuASIM to productize its quantum-enhanced simulation stack for regulated digital twin deployments.  The convergence of quantum optimization, AI-driven scenario planning, and immersive visualization positions QVR to capture the emergent "quantum industrial metaverse" niche.

**Use of Funds:**

1. Accelerate go-to-market via co-selling pilots with aerospace and pharma integrators (35%).
2. Harden cloud-native orchestration and security certifications (25%).
3. Expand quantum model library, focusing on attractor rendering and decoherence mitigation (20%).
4. Establish customer success and compliance teams in EU + APAC (20%).

**Milestones (next 18 months):**

- Secure three lighthouse deployments with annual contract value (ACV) > $2M each.
- Achieve SOC2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications.
- Release v2.0 of SuperTransformer kernel with QPU-in-the-loop co-processing.

**Exit Outlook:** Strategic acquisition by GPU/cloud incumbents or IPO readiness by FY2029 contingent on $150M+ ARR trajectory.  Strong regulated digital twin demand and GenAI infrastructure tailwinds lift upper valuation bound to $450M–$500M if traction continues to accelerate.
