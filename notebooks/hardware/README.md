# Hardware Tier Notebooks

This directory stores engineering notebooks that accompany the QuASIM hardware tier bundle. They
outline calibration routines, PTAQ register allocation, and failure-mode analysis scenarios that map
to the entries in `docs/QUBIT_REGISTER.md`.

## Included Templates

- `ptaQ_calibration.ipynb` — Placeholder notebook documenting calibration logic.
- `lifecycle_tracking.ipynb` — Placeholder notebook describing maintenance cadence tracking.

The actual notebooks are generated as part of internal release processes. For external distribution,
refer to the zipped artifacts produced by the QuASIM Full Package Builder.
